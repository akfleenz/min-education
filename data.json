Students are funded under either a Very High or a High needs level, and in 2010 a third ‘extension’ category was created to include an additional 400 students with moderate-to-high special needs, who were older than nine and had missed out on the ORS by a narrow margin in the past.",

It is a voluntary survey run across primary and secondary schools.  The student attendance data is grouped by ethnicity, decile, gender and year level, school type and education region.

While one school may opt to suspend a student over a particular incident, another school may not. The number of these incidents should not be used as a proxy measure for student behaviour. This indicator uses age-standardised rates. These are expressed as the number of stand-downs, suspensions, exclusions and expulsions per 1,000 students enrolled. (Most stand-downs, suspensions and exclusions occur between the ages of 13-15). Age-standardisation allows a fair comparison between different cohorts. In any given year the schooling population will have a different age distribution. By standardising for age we can compare across years.",

        "description": "This mathematics indicator draws on three sources of information:\nFor state and state-integrated schools that use the New Zealand Curriculum, a summary of the National Standards mathematics results are provided. National Standards results are based on Overall Teacher Judgements (OTJs) about whether students in Years 1-8 were achieving at a level 'well below', 'below', 'at', or 'above' the standard in mathematics for their year level.\nFor state and state-integrated kura and schools that use Te Marautanga o Aotearoa (mainly Māori medium education schools), the Ngā Whanaketanga Rumaki Māori results in the pāngarau (mathematics) skill area are used. Ngā Whanaketanga Rumaki Māori (NWRM) are the Māori medium equivalent of National Standards.\nAn overview of selected findings from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study 2014/2015 (TIMSS 2014/2015) is also included. The TIMSS assessments included questions on whole numbers, decimals and common fractions, two- and three- dimensional shapes, estimation, data representation, and patterns and relationships.",

        "description": "In the context of Ngā Whanaketanga Rumaki Māori, kōrero relates to oral communication or speaking. Oral communication is an important part of Māori culture and, more generally, an important part of conversing and connecting with others regardless of culture. Kōrero is especially important with Māori because up until the 19th century Māori was not a written language and speaking was the primary means of sharing information, or stories, and passing knowledge down through generations. Speaking in person also conveys the emotional or spiritual aspects of a message more strongly.",
