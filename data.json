Students are funded under either a Very High or a High needs level, and in 2010 a third ‘extension’ category was created to include an additional 400 students with moderate-to-high special needs, who were older than nine and had missed out on the ORS by a narrow margin in the past.",

It is a voluntary survey run across primary and secondary schools.  The student attendance data is grouped by ethnicity, decile, gender and year level, school type and education region.

While one school may opt to suspend a student over a particular incident, another school may not. The number of these incidents should not be used as a proxy measure for student behaviour. This indicator uses age-standardised rates. These are expressed as the number of stand-downs, suspensions, exclusions and expulsions per 1,000 students enrolled. (Most stand-downs, suspensions and exclusions occur between the ages of 13-15). Age-standardisation allows a fair comparison between different cohorts. In any given year the schooling population will have a different age distribution. By standardising for age we can compare across years.",

Oral communication is an important part of Māori culture and, more generally, an important part of conversing and connecting with others regardless of culture. Kōrero is especially important with Māori because up until the 19th century Māori was not a written language and speaking was the primary means of sharing information, or stories, and passing knowledge down through generations. Speaking in person also conveys the emotional or spiritual aspects of a message more strongly.",

Data captured is for a one week period, typically the last week in June and includes information about the services, enrolment/attendance numbers, teaching staff, and the use of languages.\nFrom 2000 to 2013, all ECE Census data was collected from paper-based RS61 returns. On these forms, enrolment data described regular enrolments in ECE licensed services regardless if children was absent during the return week. In 2014, the method for data collection changed and around 40% of services completed the Annual Census using the Ministry's new electronic collection tool for ECE: ELI.  In 2019, the proportion of licensed services using ELI rose to 90%. For these services, the data collected relates to attendances in ECE licensed services, not enrolments. Only Te Kōhanga Reo, casual and hospital-based services filed paper-based RS61 returns. This is a change to the definition of the data and means that the data should not be compared to previous years.",
